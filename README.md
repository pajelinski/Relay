# Relay
Relay is a solution to recruitment task. After long consideration, I decided to go with TPL Dataflow and I'm rather pleased with the result.
I tried to keep this as simple as possible. I decided to ignore logging and I did not use container - this recruitment task wasn't big enough.

The solution consists of unit tests, implementation, demo application, and benchmarks.

# How to benchmark:
In order to run benchmark build solution in release configuration. Next run Relay.Benchmark app in a console.
